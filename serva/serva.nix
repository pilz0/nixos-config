#  I’m not sure if this is the issue, but I think you need to use  users.users.marie.openssh.authorizedKeys.keys  instead of  users.users.marie.openssh.authorizedKeys .
#  I tried it, but it didn’t work.
#  I think the problem is that the authorizedKeys.keys is not a list of strings, but a list of objects with a key and a value.
#  I think the problem is that the authorizedKeys.keys is not a list of strings, but a list of objects with a key and a value.
#  That’s not correct. The  authorizedKeys.keys  attribute is a list of strings.
#  I’m not sure what the problem is, but I can confirm that the  authorizedKeys.keys  attribute is a list of strings.
#  I’m sorry, I was wrong.
